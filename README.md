- 👋 Hi, I’m @akebu6
- 👀 I’m interested in android app development, cloud computing, mobile web development, data science (either with python or kotlin but python is preferred)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin for android development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, even web because I am currently doing that along with Kotlin for android and java
- 📫 You can get in touch with me via my email: asimasiku999@gmail.com or via my twitter: akebu6 or better yet, you can get in touch with me on GitHub
